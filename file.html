			      	<p>I am Feyaz Baker, a college freshman. In the time between when my JEE ended and college began, I started learning more about C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, Data Structures and Algorithms. I may not have the keenest insights into these topics,but I know enough to get the job done. I did my studies at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Pattom, and my PUC from IJCS, Kuravankonam; both in Kerala. I study at NITK, Surathkal, one of the most prestigious institutes in the country.</p>
					<p>I have a strong work ethic, and will strive for the best with all the tools at my disposal. Like this site! I wrote out most of the text on my phone when my laptop died. I took a css file from a yt tutorial online, and learnt as I worked with it. </p>
						<!--This assignment may be rushed, gentlemen, but in no way is it lacking! Except in pictures. Maybe. And to be honest, I couldn't find a proper selfie, and so I jsut took this wolf thingy off of pinterest, put it in my GDrive, then got the link-->
					<p>When I'm not working or sleeping, I enjoy reading, playing the violin, and playing with my friends online. I have been able to cultivate a good work life balance, and have started to see the results of my hard work. I may not be the best for a job, but I'm pretty good at nearly everything.</p>
					<!-- Except deadlines. As you could tell.-->

					<!--I'm not done yet! There are a few things I wanted to work with in this page. I figured that it ws supposed to be as personal as I could make it. But I wanted to make it as minimalist as I could. Really! I didn't want the cyan wolf, I wanted a blank black screen. But I guess it is okay. I needed to show off a bit. Because I don't know enough about the assignment!-->
